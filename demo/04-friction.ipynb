    "In the previous demos, we've looked exclusively at systems that conserve energy.\n",
    "Many of the problems we're interested in are not purely energy-conserving because the dynamics have dissipative parts as well, such as bottom friction or viscosity.\n",
    "In this demo, we'll show how to add bottom friction to the shallow water model and how to solve this problem using an *implicit-explicit* timestepping scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the schemes we've used so far have been purely explicit -- the system state at the next step is a simple function of its current state.\n",
    "Implicit schemes instead define the state at the next step as the solution of possibly complex nonlinear system.\n",
    "These types of schemes are more expensive than their explicit counterparts, but they can give much better results for dynamics with a very rapid relaxation timescale, such as viscous diffusion of momentum.\n",
    "These types of problems are called *stiff* in the numerical literature.\n",
    "An implicit-explicit or IMEX method combines both types -- explicit for the non-stiff dynamics, implicit for the stiff dynamics."
